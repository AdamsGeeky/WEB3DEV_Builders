# README: Web3 App Development Journey üöÄ

Welcome to my Web3 App Development Repository! This repository documents my exploration of building decentralized applications (dApps) and mastering the tools, frameworks, and concepts essential to Web3 development.  

## Topics Covered  

### **Blockchain Basics**  
- [Fundamentals of blockchain and distributed ledger technology](./basic/README.md)  

### **Programming for Web3**  
- **Rust**: Developing secure and high-performance blockchain applications.  
- **Solidity**: Writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains.  

### **Consensus Mechanisms**  
- Deep dive into consensus models like Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), and their relevance in app development.  

### **Token Standards and Systems**  
- **ERC-20**: Creating fungible tokens for DeFi and other applications.  
- **ERC-721**: Developing NFTs for digital assets, collectibles, and gaming.  
- **ERC-1155**: Implementing multi-token standards for hybrid token scenarios.  
- **Token System Design**: Building robust tokenomics for Web3 applications.  

### **Stablecoin Applications**  
- Exploring the design and integration of stablecoins in decentralized applications.  
- Understanding pegging mechanisms, reserve models, and use cases in payments and DeFi.  

### **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**  
- Implementing ZKPs for privacy-preserving Web3 applications.  
- Exploring zk-rollups for scalability in decentralized applications.  

### **Interoperability SDKs**  
- Leveraging tools to integrate cross-chain functionalities into dApps, enabling seamless interaction with multiple blockchain networks.  

### **Mini Projects and Practical Applications**  
To solidify my learning

## Goals  
This repository is a resource for:  
- Showcasing my Web3 app development journey through well-documented projects.  
- Providing insights for developers and learners interested in decentralized technologies.
