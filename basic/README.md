## Day 4: Making Your First Blockchain Transaction
- [ ] **Set Up a Wallet**
  - Download **MetaMask** and configure it for the Sepolia testnet.
  - Learn about private keys and secret phrases.

- [ ] **Make a Transaction**
  - Request ETH from the Sepolia Faucet.
  - Send ETH to another wallet and review it on **Etherscan**.

- [ ] **Gas Fees**
  - What is Gas, Wei, and Gwei?
  - ETH Gas Station and how gas fees are calculated.

### Assignment
- [ ] Perform a transaction on the Sepolia testnet and document the process.
- [ ] Calculate the gas fee for the transaction in Wei, Gwei, and Ether.

## Day 5: How Does Blockchain Work?
- [ ] **Key Concepts**
  - [ ] **Hashing:** Explain hash functions and their role in blockchain security.
  - [ ] **Blockchain Demo:** Visualize a blockchain with tools like [blockchaindemo.io](https://blockchaindemo.io).

- [ ] **Transactions and Signing**
  - Public and private keys.
  - How transactions are signed and verified.

### Assignment
- [ ] Use a hashing tool (e.g., SHA-256 demo) to hash a string and explore how changing input affects output.

---

## Day 6: Consensus Mechanisms and High-Level Fundamentals
- [ ] **Consensus Mechanisms**
  - [ ] **Proof of Work (PoW):** Mining and computational effort.
  - [ ] **Proof of Stake (PoS):** Validator selection and staking.

- [ ] **Key Challenges**
  - Sybil attacks, double-spending, replay attacks.

- [ ] **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**
  - Introduction to ZKPs and their role in privacy and scalability.

- [ ] **Layer 2 Solutions**
  - Importance of rollups and scalability.
  - Overview of ZKsync and why it’s recommended.

### Assignment
- [ ] Research and summarize the key differences between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake.
- [ ] Explore ZKsync Bridge and document how transactions are processed.
