# Mastering Rust and Blockchain with Polkadot SDK Study Guide 📘

Welcome to my personal learning journey through **Rust** and **Blockchain Development** using the **Polkadot SDK**! 🚀 This repo is a record of my progress, challenges, and breakthroughs as I explore Rust programming and blockchain concepts with hands-on projects.

---

## 🌟 Overview

This repository is inspired by the goal to demystify Rust and the Polkadot SDK by building projects from scratch. Rust’s unique features and the powerful Substrate macros in the Polkadot SDK are a challenge, but I'm here to tackle them head-on!

**Why this repo?**  
The goal is to document:
- My understanding of Rust's advanced concepts.
- How the Polkadot SDK and Substrate work under the hood.
- Building my own blockchain project by applying pure Rust.

## 📍 Study Objectives

This guide is structured around three main objectives:
1. **Building Rust Foundations** – Learning Rust’s advanced features like ownership, traits, generics, and error handling.
2. **Understanding Blockchain Essentials** – Delving into core blockchain concepts such as consensus, transactions, and storage models.
3. **Replicating Polkadot SDK Functionality** – Exploring how Substrate macros simplify blockchain programming and applying similar techniques in my projects.

## 🛠️ Current Structure and Study Plan

> Each section below will document my notes, code snippets, and reflections on the concepts covered.

### 1. **Rust Basics and Setup**
   - Setting up Rust, Cargo, and basic tooling
   - Variables, data types, ownership, and memory management
   - Key Rust data structures: structs, enums, and traits

### 2. **Building Core Components in Rust**
   - Implementing foundational components like error handling, modules, and generics
   - Developing a custom Rust project structure mimicking Polkadot’s modularity
   - Testing and debugging Rust code

### 3. **Blockchain Concepts with Polkadot SDK**
   - Learning the basics of blockchain architecture
   - Understanding consensus, cryptographic functions, and data integrity
   - Replicating essential features found in Polkadot SDK with Rust

## 📚 Resources

Here are the main resources I'm following:
- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) – Chapters 1-11 are especially helpful for Rust basics.
- **Polkadot SDK Documentation** – Reference materials on using Substrate macros and modules.
